### What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?

I'm working on the **NeuroNutrition App**, a healthcare web application for nutrition practitioners and patients. The project uses:

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Cloud Functions, Hosting)
- Architecture: pnpm monorepo with 3 Firebase Hosting sites

**Project Structure:**
- `apps/patient-vite/` - Patient React app (production)
- `apps/practitioner-vite/` - Practitioner React app (production)
- `apps/shared-api/` - Shared backend API (in development)
- `packages/shared-charts/` - Shared chart components (new)
- `functions/` - Cloud Functions (Node.js 20)

**Key Features:**
- Life Journey questionnaire (SIIN method): 35 questions, 7 spheres, weighted scoring 0-180 points
- Multi-user system: patients, practitioners, admin roles
- Real-time dashboards with Recharts
- Invitation-based patient signup
- Firestore for data, Firebase Auth for login

**Current Work:**
Phase 1: Creating `packages/shared-charts` to share chart components (LifeJourneyRadar, hooks)
Phase 2: Building `apps/shared-api` backend on `neuronutrition-app.web.app` for REST API endpoints

**Development Environment:**
- OS: Windows
- Shell: PowerShell (pwsh)
- Package Manager: pnpm 9.15.4
- Node: v20.12.2

**Firebase Sites:**
- `neuronutrition-app-patient.web.app` (patient frontend)
- `neuronutrition-app-practitioner.web.app` (practitioner frontend)
- `neuronutrition-app.web.app` (shared backend - NEW)

### How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

**Code Style:**
- Use TypeScript strict mode with explicit types
- React: Functional components only, hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (utility-first, dark mode support)
- Import paths: Use `@/` alias for absolute imports
- File naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks/utils

**Communication:**
- Be specific: Provide exact file paths, line numbers, commands
- Be concise: No fluff, get to the point
- Be actionable: Give clear next steps and runnable commands
- Be thorough: Test changes, verify builds before deploying

**When helping with code:**
- Match existing patterns and conventions
- Add TypeScript types for everything
- Include error handling (try/catch, set error states)
- Add console.log with component name prefix: `console.log('[Component] Context:', variable)`
- Use Tailwind classes matching the project theme (nn-primary-500, slate-950, emerald-500)

**When solving problems:**
1. Analyze the error message carefully
2. Check related files and imports
3. Propose a solution with code snippets
4. Provide commands to test the fix
5. Suggest related improvements

**Auto-Approval Mode:**
When I say "full approved", "auto allow", "keep", or "overnight coding session":
- Proceed with all changes confidently without asking permission
- Deploy automatically after successful builds
- Clean up unused files
- Document changes

**Priorities:**
1. Make builds succeed (especially practitioner app)
2. Avoid code duplication (use shared packages)
3. Maintain type safety (TypeScript strict)
4. Keep architecture scalable (prepare for mobile)
5. Follow Firebase best practices (security rules, indexes)

**Don't:**
- Use `any` type (prefer `unknown` or specific types)
- Create class components (only functional)
- Duplicate code between apps (create shared package)
- Deploy without building first
- Ignore TypeScript errors

**Always:**
- Provide full file paths (C:/Dev/apps/patient-vite/src/...)
- Include package.json changes if adding dependencies
- Test builds before deployment
- Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md if architecture changes
- Use pnpm (not npm) for installations

**Current Phase: 🚀 FULL AUTO-APPROVAL - Overnight Coding Session**
